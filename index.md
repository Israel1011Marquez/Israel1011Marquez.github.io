## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs


*Lab 03 part 1: 

    I enjoyed this lab because as someone who prioritizes health and fitness this calculator was an amazing entry to what exactly I can use coding for. As someone who aspires to be a personal trainer I can refer back to this calculator to find out my clients BMIâ€™s. I can also use this method of coding to find out different information like what would be their caloric deficit or surplus. 

*Lab 09 part 2:

    This was a fun lab because I believe it was a good entry to learning how to code a game. I have always wondered how video games always seem to have a response for different outcomes that are decided by the player. After coding this lab I learned to appreciate developers more due to them having to input the outcomes manually. I hope to take the knowledge I have learned in this lab and use it for future projects.

*Lab 12 part 1: 

    Lab 12 was the hardest in my opinion because of its intricacy. However, I enjoyed making my first animation through coding. This is a skill that I believe can open up a lot of doors in the future and therefore lead more to more opportunities. I have always wondered how typing code can lead to an animated image but after the lab I learned the basics in patterns used to cause this action.
